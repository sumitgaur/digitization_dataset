PRELIMINARY INTERNATIONAL OFFERING CIRCULAR
DATED 9 NOVEMBER 2019

Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco)
This international offering circular (the "International Offering Circular") has been prepared by Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi
Aramco) ("Saudi Aramco") in connection with the initial public offering (the "Offering") of the shares of Saudi Aramco (the
"Shares"), consisting of a sale by the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (the "Selling Shareholder") of a portion of the
Shares (the "Offer Shares"). The Offer Shares are being offered at a price range of SAR
to SAR
per Share (the
"Offer Price Range").
The Offering is being made outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (the "Kingdom") (the "International Offering") to institutional investors
(i) outside the United States in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Regulation S ("Regulation S") under the United
States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "U.S. Securities Act"), and (ii) inside the United States to persons reasonably believed to be
qualified institutional buyers ("QIBs") in reliance on Rule 144A ("Rule 144A") under the U.S. Securities Act. Inside the Kingdom, the
Offering is being conducted as a public offering (the "Domestic Offering"). The International Offering is being made solely on the basis of
this International Offering Circular, which includes an English language translation of the Arabic language prospectus that is being utilised
solely for the Domestic Offering (the "Domestic Offering Prospectus").
The final price at which the Offer Shares will be sold (the "Final Offer Price"), the number of Offer Shares to be sold and the percentage that
the Offer Shares to be sold represent of the outstanding Shares will be determined at the end of the Book-Building Period (as defined in the
Domestic Offering Prospectus) and will be published in international media outlets, as well as on Saudi Aramco's website).
Investing in the Offer Shares involves certain risks and uncertainties. See Section 2 (Risk Factors) of the
Domestic Offering Prospectus included in this International Offering Circular for a discussion of certain
factors to be carefully considered in connection with a decision to invest in the Offer Shares.
Prior to the Offering, there has been no public market for the Offer Shares in the Kingdom or elsewhere. Saudi Aramco has submitted an
application to the Capital Market Authority of Saudi Arabia (the "CMA") for the registration and admission to listing of the Offer Shares on
The Saudi Stock Exchange (the "Exchange" or "Tadawul"'). Trading of the Shares is expected to commence after all relevant legal
requirements and procedures have been completed. An announcement of the commencement of trading of the Shares will be made on
Tadawul's website (www.tadawul.com.sa).
Prospective purchasers are hereby notified that sellers of the Offer Shares may be relying on an exemption from the provisions of
Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. The Offer Shares are not transferable except in accordance with the
restrictions described in "Transfer Restrictions" of this International Offering Circular and all applicable laws.
Qualified Foreign Investors will be permitted to trade in the Shares in accordance with the QFI Rules and Foreign Strategic Investors will be
permitted to trade in the Shares in accordance with FSI Instructions (each as defined in the Domestic Offering Prospectus). Furthermore,
non-Saudi nationals who are not resident in the Kingdom and institutions incorporated outside the Kingdom (other than Qualified Foreign
Investors and Foreign Strategic Investors) (each a "Foreign Investor") will be permitted to acquire an economic interest in the Shares by
entering into a swap agreement with a person authorised by the CMA to acquire, hold and trade in Offer Shares on the Exchange on behalf of
a Foreign Investor (the "Authorised Person"). Under such swap agreements, the Authorised Person will be the registered legal owner of such
Offer Shares.

Average is not a weighted or arithmetic average but a selection of what a typical new oil project in that country would cost in today's market. New oil
projects selected by country from 2019G-onwards.
(2)
The breakeven price for producing fields in the Kingdom is forward-looking and hence excludes all exploration and development costs. The break-even
price for the Kingdom (for the three categories-producir fields, onshore and offshore) is calculated assuming an income tax rate of 50%. The analysis is
carried out for typical new projects starting in 2019G.
(3)
The break-even for U.S. Onshore excludes land acquisition cost.
Demand growth for crude oil, condensate and NGLS is expected to continue, with a levelling off around the year
2035G. Global supply is expected to move in line with demand, with an expected increase in market share from
lowest cost producers, including the Kingdom. Consequently, between 2015G and 2050G, the Kingdom's daily
crude oil, condensate and NGLs supply volumes are expected to increase at a CAGR of 0.9%
Alternatively in a scenario representing a more rapid transition away from fossil fuels, demand for crude oil,
condensate and NGLs starts to decline in the late 2020Gs. In this scenario, the Kingdom's share of global supply is
also expected to increase through 2050G, with the Kingdom's daily crude oil, condensate and NGLs supply
volumes expected to increase at a CAGR of 0.7% between 2015G and 2050G. The following chart illustrates actual
and expected supply of crude oil, condensate and NGLS from 2015G to 2050G under both demand scenarios.

Key audit matter
Impairment of non-financial assets
In relation to impairment of property, plant and equipment, the carrying values of the property, plant and
equipment are reviewed annually by management for potential indicators of impairment. For such assets where
impairment indicators exist, management performs detailed impairment reviews, taking into account, inter alia,
the impact of revenue assumptions, technical factors, usage and economic condition which may affect the
expected remaining useful lives and carrying value of the assets.
In relation to impairment of goodwill, management performs an annual impairment test on the recoverability of
the goodwill. Accordingly, the management assesses the recoverable amount of each cash generating unit (CGU)
or group of CGUs to which the goodwill relates, to determine if an impairment is required or not. In this regard,
management needs to apply considerable judgement in allocating the goodwill to the appropriate business units
as well as in assessing the future performance and prospects of each CGU and the discount rates to apply.

Changes in accounting policies
IFRS 16 - Leases
The Group has adopted IFRS 16 from its mandatory adoption date 1 January 2019 using the modified simplified
transition approach as permitted under the specific transition provisions in the standard. As a result, comparatives
have not been restated.
The Group has not used the practical expedient of applying IFRS 16 to only those contracts that were previously
identified as leases under IAS 17 (and IFRIC 4). In adopting IFRS 16, the Group has applied the following
practical expedients:
the use of a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics;
accounting for operating leases in accordance with IAS 17 as short-term leases with a remaining lease term
of less than 12 months at 1 January 2019;
exclusion of initial direct costs for the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application;
the use of hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or terminate
the lease; and
the election, by class of underlying asset, not to separate non-lease components from lease components, and
instead account for each lease component and any associated non-lease components as a single lease
component.
As at 1 January 2019, the Group has recognised additional lease liabilities amounting to SR 6.83 billion and
associated right-of-use assets amounting to SR 7.29 billion in relation to contracts that have been concluded as
leases under the principles of IFRS 16. The liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease
payments, discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate. The associated right-of-use assets are
measured at the amount equal to the lease liabilities, adjusted by the amount of prepayments relating to that lease
recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2018. The Group's weighted
average incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities was 4.04%.
The following table shows the reconciliation of operating lease commitments under IAS 17 to the lease liabilities
under IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019:

Leases are recognised as right-of-use assets along with their corresponding liabilities at the date of which the
leased assets are available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance
cost. The finance cost is recognised in the interim condensed consolidated statement of income over the lease
term. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a
straight-line basis.
Right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost comprising the amount of the initial measurement of lease
liability, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, any
initial direct costs, and restoration costs; if applicable.
Lease liabilities include, if applicable, the net present value of fixed payments including in-substance fixed
payments, less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate,
amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees, the exercise price of a purchase
